        Typical Sport and Recreation Services
        Sport and recreation organisations are service organisations, and ensuring that the quality of services meets the expectations of customers must be a high priority of those who manage the organisation. Failure to attain this objective leads to a diminished reputation and competiveness in the market place, and a consequential loss of customers.
        
        The CORE SERVICES provided by any sport and recreation are:
        
        Coaching
        Sport and Recreation experiences are more rewarding when participants receive instruction from "experts". As a result of such instruction and the skills learnt by participants, they will usually reach a higher standard of performance, acquire greater knowledge "of the game" and play more safely.</p>

        Facility Maintenance
        The provision of facilities so that there is essential equipment and space to enable participation is a vital aspect of sport and recreation. Facilities need to be carefully maintained to comply with rules of sport and/or to enable participants to play safely.
        
        Organisation of Programs and Events
        The organisation and scheduling of events and programs is a key service that enables people to actually participate.
